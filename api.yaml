          Note that the ``.trace`` method will almost always be preferred

          should only be used if manual parenting is desired.

          This is useful for attaching information to the local root span
          of the current execution/process, which is often also service
          entry span.

          For example::

          The returned span *must* be ``finish``ed or it will remain in memory
